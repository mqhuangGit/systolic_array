# systolic_array

This work focuses on the optimization of systolic data processing module in CNN.   

**Atom-systolic** cantains the codes of calculation module in atom-systolic architecture, and  **Dual-line-systolic** contains the codes in dual-line-systolic architecture.

The system architecture of whole CNN accelerator can be referred from the **[NVDLA](https://github.com/nvdla/ "NVDLA github")**.
